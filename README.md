Hey Their Programmers !!! I have made a  elegant C++ console project built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and arrays.
It basically allows users to manage hotel room bookings (with multiple floors and dynamic pricing) and travel packages within a single system.

 Features:
 
Two hotel floors with different room prices
Book, view, and manage hotel rooms
Explore and book travel packages
Interactive menu-driven interface
Fully implemented using classes, objects, functions, and arrays

i have been carefully build it as a beginner-friendly project demonstrating core OOP concepts and data handling in C++ so that a Beginner in this field find it helpful and effect Enjoy it!!!
